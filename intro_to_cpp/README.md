# Introduction to C++
Small programs to learn the C++ programming language


#### Foreword
When I wrote the programs, I had just finished AP Computer Science, which taught the C programming language. I decided that the next step was to learn C++. C++ has object-oriented support, the Standard Template Library, and a dedicated string class, as well as all the functionality and speed of C.

### Hello
This was my first C++ program that I ever wrote. At the time, the only resources I had were my knowledge of C and my web browser.  
I found that printing "Hello World" to the console was relatively easy, especially coming from a C background, so I decided to experiment with for-loops, input, and strings. 

The program prints "Hello World", then prompts the user to enter a string. After, some for-loops run. If the user entered a string of at least length 5, the length of the entered string is printed.

### Division Rules
This was the second C++ program I wrote. I wanted to build my proficiency in C++ with a more complicated program. I wanted to use more built-in C++ features, such as the Standard Template Library.

The user enters a number at the command line. The number's divisibility by numbers from 2 to 10 are determined and printed. Divisibility is determined using grade-school rules. An example is: "A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the number's digits is divisible by 3."

I chose not to rely on the modulo operator. I wanted to go more in depth about C++'s syntax and fully apply what I learned in the Hello World program. The lack of using the modulo operator forced me to use loops, string parsing, the `std::vector`, and more complex conditional statements.  
As stated in line 73, "This could be way easier, but I needed a challenge."
