### Connect 4

A two-player game where the first player to get 4 pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) is the winner.

On their turn, players select a column to drop their pieces in by entering a column number. Any invalid column number entered will require the player to re-enter a number.

The game automatically detects if a player achieved a win. If all the board spaces are taken, the game is declared a tie.
