# Miscellaneous Projects
Contains any project that does not fit into a set category, or is too small to be its own repo.

All programs written in C may require a header called `cs50.h`. Any program that requires `cs50.h` was written while I still used the AP Computer Science IDE. `cs50.h` contains input functions for the standard input and a typedef that converts `char*` to `string`.

Each directory contained in this repo is its own separate project.
